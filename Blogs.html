            <h1>My connection with The city of Joy</h1>
        <small>12th November, 2022</small>
        <p>Kolkata whose nick name is “The City of Joy” is my city, my home. It’s an emotion for Bengal and the soul of Bengalis. The city at dusk through the heavy dark thunder clouds, the incessant noise from the crowded streets, the familiar and the unfamiliar faces, the multiple options of local savouries -these rejuvenate me. Born and brought up for the most part in Kolkata, my Bengali genes are to be blamed not only for my relentless creative pursuits but also my unsatiated taste-buds. Wherever I go or whichever city I have lived in and set up our homes later in my life, there has always been a reference to something or someplace or somebody or some incident in Kolkata.</p>
        <p>My affection for Kolkata baffles me. For me it’s one of the most romantic cities in the world, with the river Ganga and with old lanes and old palaces. My friends who have no prior experience of Kolkata, often ask me – ‘What do you like about Kolkata? ’or ‘Hey, we want to visit Kolkata. What do you suggest we should see?’ These questions make me nervous as well as excited. Nervous, because I want them to love my Kolkata. Excited, because I have a never-ending things-to-do-list which I have to always hand over!</p>
        <p>For me, the only way to experience Kolkata is to feel the city, live the city. For those who haven’t had any prior ‘Kolkata’ experience, I hope I can show them the true Kolkata – in my way.</p>
